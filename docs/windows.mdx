## Windows

## CMakeLists

You will need to disable the `/WX` compiler flag.

In your project, open the `windows/CMakeList.txt` file and find the following line:

`target_compile_options(${TARGET} PRIVATE /W4 /WX /wd"4100")`

Delete the `/WX`:

`target_compile_options(${TARGET} PRIVATE /W4 /wd"4100")`


## ANGLE build (not currently working)
To support embedding GPU textures in Flutter (rather than copying to a CPU pixel buffer on every frame), we need to build a slightly customized version of Filament that uses GLES on Windows (rather than the default, which uses OpenGL).

```
git checkout flutter-filament-windows
mkdir out && cd out
"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\Common7\IDE\CommonExtensions\Microsoft\CMake\CMake\bin\cmake.exe" --build . --target gltf_viewer --config Debug
```
